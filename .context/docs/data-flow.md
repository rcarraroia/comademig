_Add descriptive content here._

## Internal Movement

<!-- Describe how modules collaborate (queues, events, RPC calls, shared databases). -->

_Add descriptive content here (optional)._

## External Integrations

<!-- Document each integration with purpose, authentication, payload shapes, and retry strategy. -->
