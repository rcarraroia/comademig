## Testing Strategy

<!-- Document how quality is maintained across the codebase. -->

_Add descriptive content here._

## Test Types

<!-- For Unit, Integration, and E2E tests: list frameworks, file naming conventions, and required tooling. -->

- **Unit**: Jest, files named `*.test.ts`
- **Integration**: Describe scenarios
- **E2E**: Note harnesses or environments

## Running Tests

<!-- Commands for running all tests, watch mode, and coverage. Use code blocks. -->

- All tests: `npm run test`
- Watch mode: `npm run test -- --watch`
- Coverage: `npm run test -- --coverage`

## Quality Gates

<!-- Define minimum coverage expectations. Capture linting or formatting requirements before merging. -->

- _Item 1_
- _Item 2_
- _Item 3_

## Troubleshooting

<!-- Document flaky suites, long-running tests, or environment quirks. -->

_Add descriptive content here (optional)._
